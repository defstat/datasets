# OJS, OMP, and OPS Testing Datasets

This repository contains data sets generated by the integration test suite built into OJS, OMP, and OPS.

## Contents

The generated datasets contain...

- One single context: a journal (OJS), a press (OMP), or a server (OPS), with basic policies, contact information, etc. Language configuration is for French and English.
- Users:
  - Administrator: username `admin`, password `admin`
  - Editor: username `dbarnes`, password `dbarnesdbarnes`
  - Additional users per these lists: [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/main/cypress/tests/data/10-ApplicationSetup/40-CreateUsers.cy.js#L19..L127) [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp/blob/main/cypress/tests/data/10-ApplicationSetup/40-CreateUsers.cy.js#L19..L157) [OPS](https://github.com/pkp/ops/blob/main/cypress/tests/data/10-ApplicationSetup/40-CreateUsers.cy.js#L19..L57)
  - By convention, the passwords are the usernames repeated twice (except for `admin`).
- Submissions: A variety of published and unpublished content in various stages, depending on the application

## Layout

The data sets are organized in `application` / `branch or tag name` / `dbms`:

- `application` is `ojs`, `omp`, or `ops`
- `branch name` is e.g. `stable-3_3_0` or `3_3_0-1`
- `dbms` is either `mysql` (MySQL / MariaDB) or `pgsql` (PostgreSQL)

Within each dataset, you will find:

- `database.sql`: Database dump
- `config.inc.php`: OJS configuration file
- `public`: Directory containing the OJS public files
- `files`: Directory containing the OJS `files_dir` (In production this should *not* be web-accessible)

## Tools

Note: These tools are generally intended to be run from the OJS/OMP/OPS installation directory, so you will likely have to specify the path to run them. In the examples below, this repository is available in `../datasets`.

- `environment.sh`: **Configure the shell environment.**

  Example: `. ../datasets/tools/environment.sh ojs main`

- `dbclient.sh`: **Connect to the database client.**

  Example: `../datasets/tools/dbclient.sh < mydatadump.sql` (to load a database dump)
  
  Example: `../datasets/tools/dbclient.sh` (to run SQL statements from the terminal)

- `recreatedb.sh`: **Ensure an empty database is available, deleting any existing data if necessary.**

  Example: `../datasets/tools/recreatedb.sh` (you may need to provide a sudo password)

- `wipe.sh`: **Clear out the database, files directory, configuration file, etc.** This will leave the application ready to be installed.

  Example: `../datasets/tools/wipe.sh`

- `loaddb.sh`: **Load the database image from the appropriate dataset**. This will create an empty DB as needed.

  Example: `../datasets/tools/loaddb.sh` (you may need to provide a sudo password)
  
  Example: `../datasets/tools/loaddb.sh stable-3_3_0` to load a specific database version (e.g. for upgrade testing)

- `loadfiles.sh`: **Load the files environment from the appropriate dataset**. This includes file storage area, public file storage area, and configuration file.

  Example: `../datasets/tools/loadfiles.sh`
  
  Example: `../datasets/tools/loadfiles.sh stable-3_3_0` to load a set of files for a specific version (e.g. for upgrade testing)

- `load.sh`: **Load both the database and file environments from the appropriate dataset**. This is equivalent to running both `loadfiles.sh` and `loaddb.sh`.

  Example: `../datasets/tools/load.sh` (you may need to provide a sudo password)

  Example: `../datasets/tools/load.sh stable-3_3_0` to load a specific version of a dataset (e.g. for upgrade testing)

## How this is maintained

OJS, OMP, and OPS contain a [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) test suite for setting up a test environment with standardized data ([OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/tree/main/cypress/tests/data) [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp/tree/main/cypress/tests/data) [OPS](https://github.com/pkp/ops/tree/main/cypress/tests/data)). These are called the data tests.

Our github repositories are configured with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com) for continuous integration testing -- changes to these repositories result in Travis performing tests and reporting success/failure. This includes running the data tests (but also linting, unit and integration testing, etc).

Some builds in the Travis configuration are flagged using an environment variable (`SAVE_BUILD`; see `.travis.yml`) to indicate that the data resulting from the data tests should be saved. This saving is done in [`run-tests.sh`](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/main/tools/travis/run-tests.sh) just after the data tests complete.

The data is transferred from the Travis VM to this github repository using a ["machine user"](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users) Github account called `pkp-machine-user`. This user has an API token for the purpose, which is provided to Travis using an [encrypted variable in `.travis.yml`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-encrypted-variables-in-travisyml).
